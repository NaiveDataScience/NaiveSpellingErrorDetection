31	They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.
25	But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be  their gain.
45	The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
35	Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the  new sales.
23	We wouldn't be able to do business said a spokesman for  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric  Industrial Co Ltd ltMC.T.
51	If the tariffs remain in pace for any length of time  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of  exports of goods subject to tariffs to the U.S., said Tom  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker ltJames  Capel and Co.
8	In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
9	We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S.
25	Threat against  Japan because it serves as a warning to us, said a senior  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
20	Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.
17	The surplus helped fell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
30	We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we  want to defuse problems from possible U.S.
12	Retaliation, said  Paul them, chairman of textile exporters ltTaiwan Safe Group.
38	A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports  are similar to those of Japan.
23	Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
30	In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough  curbs against an might allow hard-hit producers of  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the  U.S.
21	In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been  selling below-cost semiconductors some electronics  manufacturers share that view.
21	But other businessmen said such  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.
18	That is a very short-term view, said Lawrence Mills,  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.
18	If the whoe purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will  be extended to other sources.
16	Much more serious for Hong Kong  is the disadvantaged of action restraining trade, he said.
20	The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
30	The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern  Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.
26	This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very  serious matters Button said.
25	He said Australia's concerns centre on coal and beef,  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant  U.S. Exports to that country.
11	Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the  that stand-off continue.
18	Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.
23	The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget  and record public works spending in the first half of the  financial year.
25	They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency  measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.
36	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto  Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and  Industry MITI, are due to meet in Washington this week in an  effort to end the dispute.
34	It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of  China's fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up  to 30 pct, of its vegetables.
13	The paper blamed the waste on  inadequate storage and bad preservation methods
27	It said the government had launched a national programme to  reduce waste, calling for improved technology in storage and  preservation, and greater production of additives.
7	The area  gave no further details.
27	MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy  supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres kl from 600  mln, they said.
30	The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in  Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.
29	MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the  agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.
20	They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
41	Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power  in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27  pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil 23 pct and  liquefied natural gas 21 pct, they noted.
13	It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht  from 58.7 billion.
22	Thailand's improved business climate this  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials  and semi-finished products.
19	The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
15	The department said first quarter exports expected to 60.6  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
38	export growth was smaller than expected due to lower  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
18	Products registering high export growth were jewellery up  64 pct, closing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.
21	Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332  dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.
27	Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite  making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it  could possibly increase its international market share.
30	Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil  alter Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure  supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.
18	Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary  shortage than to lose export markets
21	Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500  tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank  figures.
26	The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
13	The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration  Commission today.
19	Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the  ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
33	The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week  of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
34	The shipping sources said the various port onions appear to  be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of  each shift and then to walk off.
22	Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with  container movements most affected, but has not stopped  altogether, they said.
23	They said they could not say how long the disruption will  go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.
21	He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.
16	Trading in either crude palm oil CPO or refined palm oil  may also be introduced.
27	But he said the question was still  be considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no  decision on when to go ahead had been made.
19	The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.
8	Several factors make us move cautious Nainggolan said.
22	We want to move slowly and early so that we do not make a  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.
14	physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee  added in January 1986.
11	Rubber contracts are trade FOB, up to  five months forward.
22	Robusta coffee grades four and five are  traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,  exchange officials said.
28	The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the  introduction of futures trading later for rubber but one  official said a feasibility study was needed first.
15	No  decisions are likely until at Indonesia's elections on April  23, traders said.
36	Trade Minister all said on Monday that Indonesia, as the  world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should  expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of  the exchange would help this.
18	Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost  overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.
37	He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to  encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would  also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to  encourage participation.
18	Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start  although trading in coffee has been disappointing.
38	Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in  April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9  mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered  locally the latest exchange report said.
20	Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905  tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 bilion rupiah.
13	Total membership of the exchange is now nine orders and  44 traders.
11	They said the shipments was for April 8 to 20 delivery.
30	The mine, to be known as the Goodall project, will be owned  60 pct by WMC and 40 pct by a local W.R. Grace and Co   unit.
12	It is located 30 kms east of the Adelaide River at Mt.
41	Bundey, WMC said in a statement      It said the open-pit mine, with a conventional leach  treatment plant, is expected to produce about 50,000 ounces of  gold in its first year of production from mid-1988.
9	Annual ore  capacity will be about 750,000 tonnes.
31	Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9  trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank  with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans in  October.
22	But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu  told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its  position.
17	fell be back in position in first place within three  years, Komatsu said in an interview
34	He said that will the merger will initially reduce  Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand  Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where  it has been relatively weak.
16	But financial analysts are divided on whether and how  quickly the gamble will pay off.
20	Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in  view of the smaller bank's large debts.
18	Others argue the merger  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch  network from scratch.
7	The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive.
28	It has  expanded overseas entered the lucrative securities business  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the  wisdom of some of those moves.
9	they're made bold moves to put everything in place
17	Now  it's largely out of their hands, said Kleinwort Benson Ltd  financial analyst Simon Smithson.
80	Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
22	The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected, said one analyst.
10	But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
16	Regulations will change in the near future and if so,  we can do various things.
17	We only have to wait two or three  years, not until the 21st century, Komatsu said.
17	Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes  into the securities business at home.
22	Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, aspen's  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial  from investment banking.
21	But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu  said he hopes further deregulation will create new  opportunities.
9	We need to find new business chances, Komatsu said.
16	In some  cases the will be securities related, in some cases trust  bank related.
7	That's the kind of deregulation we want.
38	Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such  domestic securities business as profitable government bond  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
23	He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
39	The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
16	But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
6	We don't want to make case.
14	We expect this will be allowed  in two or the years, he said.
29	Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
27	The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
11	It's Sumitomo been bold in its strategies, said  Kleinwort's Smithson.
11	After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling  around
17	It will be the next decade for we see if the  strategy is right or wrong.
33	Asked by Reuters to clarify his statement on Monday in  which he said the pact should be allowed to lapse, Subroto said  Indonesia was ready to back extension of the ITA.
10	We can support extension of the sixth agreement, he said.
9	But a seventh accord we believe to be unnecessary
21	The six ITA will expire at the end of June unless a  two-thirds majority of members vote for an extension.
29	Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,  will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy  back securities pledged on May 6.
35	Some 14.9 billion marks will train from the market today as  an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively  withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with  today's allocation.
39	A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the  withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit  policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful  liquidity in the banking system.
33	Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank  over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely  April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
29	The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2  billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks  themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
38	Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much  liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the  effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main  open-market instrument for steering market interest rates.
13	Two  further pacts are likely this mouth over the next two weeks.
24	The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6  and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that  range are possible, dealers said.
17	Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it  had been hit by depressed world copper prices.
27	It reported a  net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,  compared with a net loss of 1.53 billon in 1985.
31	The company said it had been able to cut its losses because  its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu  started in the second half of 1986.
25	Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition  by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their  restructuring into a gold loan.
35	A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in  October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of  275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.
38	Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity  infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for  futher exploration and development of the company's gold  properties in the central province of Masbate.
25	Wilson Banks, general manager of ltBond Corp International  Ltd in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the  negotiations was reasonably accurate.
18	Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several  investments in the Philippines but did not give details.
35	In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World  War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and  the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life  at least until 1993.
40	Its overseas edition said the growth rate, which compares  with a target of seven pct for the the of 1987, was rather  high but the base in the first quarter of 1986 was on the low  side.
12	Industrial output grew 4.4 pct in the first quarter of  1986.
20	It said China's industrial production this year has been  normal but product quality and efficiency need further  improvement.
5	It gave no further details.
35	Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will  tell U.S. Officials at talks latter this month that  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,  a senior ministry official said.
24	imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives  by other suppliers, the official, who declined to be named,  said.
29	Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise  its farm import market, he said.
9	Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
26	Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open  its wheat market, where value and origin are regulated to  protect local farmers.
20	Australia and Canada could then increase this wheat  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
9	End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
34	U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S.
7	Suppliers and  remove quota on U.S.
4	Beef and citrus imports.
12	they countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market  share here.
27	Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has  been trying to boost imports prior to the expiry of a four-year  beef accord next March 31.
39	Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
30	U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrains  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
5	An indication of the U.S.
27	Position came last December when  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has  the potential to provide one of the largest boots to U.S.
16	Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing  some one billion dlrs in new business.
47	The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
28	To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
34	But Agriculture Minister Kato has rule out any emotional  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the  industrial sector.
25	Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these  issues should not be discussed on the same table, the official  said.
35	Shareholders will be asked to approve the issue and an  increase in authorised capital to 175 mln shares from 125 mln  at a general meeting on May 1, it said in a statement.
12	The new shares will rank for dividends declared after  October 31.
4	Amatil, in which B.A.T.
32	Industries Plc ltBTI.L  holds a 41 pct stake, said it does not expect to maintain its  largest annual dividend rate of 29 cents a share on the enlarged  capital.
38	Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain  some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will  move around 194 mln.
21	In addition, a rise in note circulation  and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110  mln stg.
17	Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions  will add some 690 mln stg to the system today.
38	He told a press conference the government planned to  increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market  to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold  the surplus at a proper level.
21	But he said the government would not allow the won to  appreciate too much in a short period of time.
13	South Korea has  been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.
8	The U.S. has been under pressure from Korea.
27	Wants South Korea to cut its trades surplus with  the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3  billion dlrs in 1985.
42	Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects  were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government  would try to hold the current account surplus to around five  billion dlrs a year for the next five years.
31	Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five  billion dlrs of current account surplus and 12 pct growth in  exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year.
13	But now  the surplus is going faster than we expected, he said.
34	Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35  pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this  year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.
31	Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a  surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr  defict in 1985 was very significant.
18	The surplus enabled the  country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first  time.
26	South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs  in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is sill among the largest  in Asia.
32	This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the  major constraints on our development Last year was a major  turning point for the Korean economy Kim said.
30	Kim said his government planned to reduce the ratio of  foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from  about 50 pct in 1986.
21	The government, however, does not want to accelerate  reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus, he  said.
27	Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation  and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,  particularly the United States.
31	We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but  we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a  prompt level, Kim said.
28	The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln  Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether  MTBE from raw material available locally, it said.
26	The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada  Inc, Hoechst Celanese corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line  Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.
38	The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials  availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the  important capital and operating advantages gained by locating  on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.
28	The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant  producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer  that can replace tetra ethyl lead.
28	Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States  where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of  health concerns, the statement added.
37	Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the  U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in  Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,  it said.
18	Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five  billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE.
13	It has a  major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.
18	The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on  stream in late 1989, the statement said.
10	CRA and Whim Creek did not disclosed the price yesterday.
30	Whim break will hold 44 pct of the consortium, while  ltAustwhim Resources NL will hold 27 pct and ltCroesus Mining  NL 29 pct, it said in a statement.
20	As reported, Forrest Gold owns two mines in Western  Australia producing a combined 37,000 ounces of gold a year.
8	It  also owns an undeveloped gold project.
29	A DIW report added the general downturn in the economy  since last Autumn had had a negative effect on the willingness  of firms to take on workers
19	It referred to a marked downturn  in the number of workers the on in the capital goods sector.
32	New orders for manufacturing industry goods have mostly  fell or stagnated in recent months, but data for February  finally showed a reversal of the trend, with a 1.9 pct rise.
7	The shares later eased back to 481p.
10	Bowater reported a  32.4 mln stg profit in 1985.
32	The company said in a statement accompanying the results  that the underlying trend showed improvement and it intended to  expand further by developing existing businesses and seeking  new opportunities
22	It added that it had appointed David Lyon, currently  managing director of Redland Plc ltRDLD.L as its new chief  executive.
27	Analysts noted that Bywater's profits of 18.9 mln stg from  13.2 mln previously had been given a boost by pension benefits  of 4.5 mln stg.
43	Profit from Australia and the Far East showed the greatest  percentage rise, jumping 55.0 pct to 15.5 mln from 10.0 mln,  while the profit from U.K. Operations rose 30.7 pct to 24.7  mln, and Europe 42.9 pct to 11.0 mln.
47	Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told  Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries  operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for  investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic  slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.
13	Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in  Norway since 1985.
33	Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's  second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved  later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would  make profit this year.
40	Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but  Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned  liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a  steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
26	Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's ltCMB.N  subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy  losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.
34	It said in a statement that the two factors led to a  squeeze on refining margins and an 18.24 pct fall in sales and  services income despite an unchanged level of activity.
42	Vieille Montagne, with is actively pursuing a  restructuring program, reported a 198 mln franc net loss, after  187 mln francs in provisions for the closure of an electrolysis  plant, compared with a 250 mln franc net profit in 1985.
35	STAND TAKEN  European Community EC member of the  International Tin Council, except Britain, have said they are  prepared to back an extension of the International Tin  Agreement, an EC spokesman said.
24	He said at a meeting of EC states' representatives here  yesterday Britain undertook to communicate its own decision to  its partners today.
17	It said it was not ready yesterday to take  a stand but did not say why.
9	He added nine other EC states backed an extension
24	Spain  and Portugal, which are not members of the International Tin  Council, raised no objections to a common EC stance in favour.
71	Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political  Affairs was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves  to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could  persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports  said, and replied It is probably too early for the figures  to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to  permit the result you have described.
30	Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift  its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove  barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.
40	The are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,  but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from  important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on  security and political issues, he said.
32	The question is whether through cooperative actions between  our governments we can reduce the trade imbalance or whether  Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist  legislation, he said.
40	A spokesman for Padaeng Industry Co Ltd, the country's sole  exporter, attributed the decline to the company's lower stocks  which averaged 5,000 tonnes in the first quarter against 16,000  tonnes in late 1985 when it began exporting.
16	The department said major buyers include China, Japan, the  Philippines, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.
18	Thailand exported 4,842 tonnes of zinc ingots during the  first quarter, down from 14,937 a year ago.
26	Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be  smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view  on the likely restitution.
20	Last week, the European Commission  accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators  protesting about low rebates
12	This might be a determining  factor in today's result, they added.
32	Ramon Diaz, Secretary of the Presidential Commission on  Good Government PCGG, said Anheuser-Busch had told the  government it was interested in buying 14 mln B shares of San  Miguel.
7	He did not disclose the offered price.
21	Diaz said Australian brewer Alan Bond's Bond Corp Holdings  Ltd had offered 150 pesos per share for the B shares
25	Diaz said New York investment bank Allen and Co Inc had  earlier said it was interested in buying all 38.1 mln  sequestered shares
22	He told Reuters last month Elders IXL Ltd  ltELXA.S, the Melbourne-based brewing company, had also bid for  the B shares.
52	The Hong Kong Economic Journal last month quoted a  spokesman of Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying  that ltBarwon Farmlands Ltd, an Australian firm owned 30 pct by  ltAriadne Australia Ltd, was planning a Filipino branch in  order to buy the entire block of 38.1 mln shares.
36	Anheuser-Busch last year made a 150 mln dlr bid to buy ltSan  Miguel Brewery Ltd, a Hong Kong listed company which is 69.65  pct owned by ltNeptunia Corp Ltd, a San Miguel Corp subsidiary.
22	The talks broke down last June after the two sides said  they could not agree on the terms of the sale.
39	High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and  an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of  fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and  U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.
30	Fund managers want quality market to park their cash in  and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they  diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.
34	A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bond rates in  the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the  currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.
28	Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital  are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily  inquiries from Japan and the United States.
19	These people have got trillions of dollars slashing about  and they don't know what to do with it.
29	Some of that is ending  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and  reasonable currency stability, National Australia Bank Ltd  economists Brian Hamley said.
8	There is a 'flight to quality, Hamley said.
25	Australia may  not be in the best economic position, but there aren't too  many other countries were you'd want to put your money.
25	The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against  the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.
35	We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.  Where some people would be concerned about the value of the  U.S. Dollar, Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose  said.
17	Why not put the money in Australia where every is cheap  and the currency looks stable
17	But turning that capital into more permanent productive  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.
35	It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the  direction in the economy, Buttrose said, adding that offshore  investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough  economic statement on May 14.
52	While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar  and hefty jumps in bond rates analysts said.
6	It will remain very edgy money
24	If something was not to be  delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one  might see a substantial outflow, Buttrose said.
28	Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough  economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and  stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.
23	They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think  they would like to leave the money here, Buttrose said.
26	Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased  interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield  Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.
42	Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an  element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency  policy when he said authorities could not take their eyes off  the yen because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.
28	Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked  successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar  with the range of 100 to 103 yen.
29	Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the  Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a  trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks
14	Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming  Australia share market.
37	It has following Wall Street and other  markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the  weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into  equities, particularly in the gold sector.
40	The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3  today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while  the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the  same period.
36	The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese  cmpanies that have invested heavily in the United States in  recent years turning their attention to undervalued real  estate, particularly in the tourism field.
31	Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star  Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs  as indicative of the type of property being sought.
28	They think they find good value real estate here which,  with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of  investment Australia needs, Buttrose added.
33	Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold  oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the  northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens
29	Bankers estimated the economy, measured in terms of gross  domestic product gdp, shrank 19 pct in real terms last year  after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.
22	This was after taking into account inflation in consume  prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.
31	Factors depressing economic activity include the  6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which  threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the  Gulf and has sapped business confidence.
40	But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September  when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis  caused by the 1982 crash of local stock markets, a comprehensive  new debt settlement program was introduced.
21	The rate crash, result of a speculative spree in forward  trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.
17	The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer  spending, thus generating an informal credit system.
19	Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are  still owed by individual and companies.
38	There was some 4.4 billion dinars about 15.7 billion dlrs  in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which  one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as  bad or doubtful debt.
16	But the government has repeatedly said it  will not allow any banks to go under.
28	The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether  debtors have regular cash flows or not.
38	Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector  is the biggest after oil.
20	Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.
31	Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day bpd  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last  year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.
41	But strategic diversification into downstream operations in  Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.
39	Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed  products such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as  crude.
15	Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason  for cautious optimism.
30	the reasons are low domestic  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will  remain steady.
34	External account are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit  Gulf.
28	Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income  of the equivalent of at 3.65 billion dlrs a year.
36	But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these  reserves may not be enough to prevent a real budget deficit for  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.
30	In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.
33	This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some  shortfall.
18	Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for  economic growth this year or next.
7	It demands on oil prices, one said.
5	This summer is  important
29	Cabinet offers Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the  economy.
22	He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.
28	Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,  unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser  and overstressed palms, they said.
27	The gross were asked for their reaction to an Oil World  newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to  drop sharply this year.
43	Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about  115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more  palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that would damage the  industry, a leading grower told Reuters.
19	The country's palm oil stacks now total some 500,000 tonnes  against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.
20	The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year  due to pressure from South American and U.S.
2	Soybean output
27	The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,  is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous  21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.
4	In addition, new U.S.
19	Soybean plantings are also expected  to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil  output peak
44	They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,  with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees  against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction  will not be felt for about another three years
25	Redland already holds about 49 pct of Monier's 156.28 mln  issued shares, he said in a brief notice to the Australian  Stock Exchange.
21	Locke said shareholders would be advised as soon as the  discussions progressed and recommended that they keep their  shares.
33	Monier shares were trading at a 1987 high of 3.10 dlrs  today, up from the previous peak of 2.80 at yesterday's close,  and well above the 1987 low of 2.18 dlrs.
36	Monier is the largest concrete roof tile manufacturer in  Australia, the U.S. And New Zealand and the world's largest  marketer of fly ash, according to its annual report for 1985/86  ended June 30.
29	It recently reported first-half 1986/87 net fell to 15.02  mln dlrs from 17.09 mln a year earlier due to the Australian  housing downturn although foreign earnings rose.
19	The company has paid no dividend since the year ended  October 31, 1983, when it paid five yen.
15	It had a 4.44 billion yen current profit in the first half  of 1985/86.
39	A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington  laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S.  Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S.  Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products.
9	But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals
22	I have  nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current  situation, Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
23	Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data  and an exaggerated sense of MITI's for to control market  forces.
5	The U.S. Has excessive expectations.
21	To stabilise  supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess  inventories since 1985 will take some time, he said.
24	Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales  in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.
26	He said if he fail in talks tomorrow and Friday to  forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. Trade  Representative Clayton Yeutter.
14	U.S. Officials said this week's  talks are unlikely to sell imposition of tariffs.
19	The one-sentence statement from Bell's headquarters  confirmed what its brokers Warburg Securities told Reuters in  London yesterday.
7	Bell previously held 10 pct of Standard.
40	Bell chairman Robert Holmes a Court, who is also a director  of Standard, was not available for comment on his company's  intentions in boosting its holding and other company officials  contacted here by Reuters declined to comment.
36	The Mainichi Shimbun quoted Nippon Steel as saying that  China's State Planning Commission and some Chinese firms have  asked Japanese makers to sell them steel works and rolling  mills to expand steelmaking cheaply.
4	It said no sources.
27	A Nippon Steel spokesman told Reuters that China has made  no such official request and the company was not considering  such sales at the moment.
22	But Mainichi quoted Nippon Steel officials as saying if  prices are reasonable, they would export their used mills to  China.
27	The paper said China's crude steel output totalled 52 mln  tonnes in calendar 1986 and that it plans to increase to 80 mln  by 1996.
18	Japan's steel industry rationalisation plan is aimed at  cutting production capacity sharply over the next few years.
26	A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends  for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded  capital.
43	Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a  joint announcement earlier that by Ronald Li, chairman of the  Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and Securities Commissioner Ray  Astin, that the listings of new B shares would be barred.
13	The official announcement said this will include the  proposal by Jardine Matheson.
44	But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as  saying We continue to believe that the issuing of B shares  would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be  given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage.
33	Keswick said the B share issue will benefit Jardine  Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue  ordinary shraes for expansion in future without diluting  existing shareholders' voting rights.
58	However, he added We certainly welcome the Secretary for  Monetary Affairs David Nendick's referral of this very  important matter to the Standing Committee on Company Law  Reform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the  development of general principles which can be embraced by all  constituents of the Hong Kong market.
71	Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political  Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves  to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could  persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports  said, and replied It is probably too early for the figures  to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to  permit the result you have described.
30	Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift  its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove  barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.
40	There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,  but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from  important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on  security and political issues, he said.
32	The question is whether through cooperative action between  our governments we can reduce the trade imbalance or whether  Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist  legislation, he said.
20	The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house  sold dollars, putting pressure on the U.S. Currency, they said.
26	The dollar was also supported by a major electrical  consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at  around 145.25 yen, they added.
19	The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New  York and 145.25 at the close here yesterday
27	This compares with the bank's estimate of a shortage in the  system of around 300 mln stg which it earlier revised up from  250 mln.
31	The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills  comprising 46 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct and seven mln  stg in band four at 9-11/16 pct.
50	A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB  from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's  outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on  April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former  chairman of both SMC and UCPB.
20	Cojuangco said the coconut Industry Investment Fund CIIF  and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.
17	Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and  represented a blue chip investment.
20	His petition said UCPB's  plans to sell the shares to SMC were a serious each of  fiduciary duties.
41	The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities  and Exchange Commission SEC by Eduardo de los Angeles, a  government nominee on the companies board.
24	De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by  the company's board.
23	On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per  share.
34	De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained  earnings of 1.33 billion loss would be wiped out by the  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of  dividends.
26	De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt  to equity ratio.
24	He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would  about the ratio to 2.5-to-1.
33	In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.
33	De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong  subsidiary ltNeptunia Corp for a down payment on the shares
12	The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board  meeting.
25	An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by  April 15.
48	The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in computer disregard  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early  disposition of the sequestered shares, San Miguel Corp said in  a statement.
53	Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have  reacted agreement on the price of the shares and the method of  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement  of the controversy by April 15, the statement added.
26	A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on  Cojuangco's court petition, adding Any statement coming from  us might be interpreted as adversarial.
38	Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel will  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United  States citizen.
30	The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln A shares,  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln B shares which  are available to foreign buyers.
11	SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among  prospective buyers.
21	They said the shares would be purchased by  the ltA.Soriano group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed  institutional investors.
22	Soriano was named as one of the buyer  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.
32	The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President  Ferdinand Marcos.
9	 lives in self-imposed exile in the  U.S..
16	The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stake dividend  announced last June.
14	We have no objection to Soriano buying the B shares, Diaz  told Reuters.
6	But everything is on hold now.
26	The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders  meeting, scheduled for May 14.
24	San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in  1985.
22	It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of  700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.
31	As previously reported the region has been undergoing a  severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since  December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet  season.
33	Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are  beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth  since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.
22	Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better  than it was, the will be some cane losses, the spokesman  said.
20	But is too early to say what they will be and more rain  is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
28	Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region  and other Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and  some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
16	Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled  towards the end of May, he said.
9	The cane crush normally runs from June to December.
20	They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50  Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week's 46.864.
32	Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender  was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award  and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.
18	They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but  declined to give a rebate figure.
25	The company said in a statement that parent company net  profit last year will rise from the 72 billion lire reported in  1985.
17	Consolidated group premium totaled 1,700 billion lire in  1986 compared with 1,490 billion the previous year.
24	Iniziativa Meta ltINZI.MI, the financial services unit of  Montedison Spa ltMONI.MI, controls the largest single stake in  Florence-based Fondiaria with 49.9 pct.
53	The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb  yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January,  due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but  Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year's  buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.
20	Output reductions by producers will take effect later this  year but are likely to be offset by increased elsewhere.
46	Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in  balance during 1987, with total non-Socialist would demand at  556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in  1986, production at 505,000 tonnes 504,000 and imports from  Socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes 50,000.
29	It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a  its quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the  last quarter.
40	The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb  compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchange  cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987  sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.
37	The company said 1986 dividend, which will be paid to the  Dutch state in its capacity of the firm's sole shareholder,  would be raised to 98 mln guilders from 70 mln guilders in  1985.
28	In an initial comment on its 1986 results DSM said the  drop in 1986 turnover had been caused mainly by losses in the  company's fertilizer division.
41	In a speech to the Institut of Contempory German Affairs  here, Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aim  for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to  correct the trade deficit.
23	He said the United States could face a vicious circle of  depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that  rate.
12	Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet  U.S.
22	Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,  accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating  above-target money supply growth
52	He said he would have been happy to have brought forward  five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to  the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced  political constraints getting such measures through the upper  house of the West German parliament.
21	But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could  accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
34	Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about  one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial  erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing  demand at home.
17	A further appreciation of the mark could even be an  obstacles to further growth, he said.
39	Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply  growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and  because external factors, including low oil prices and  favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
14	But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma  over monetary policy.
31	The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the  reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany  was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
28	For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more  on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary  money supply.
8	But we must be very careful, he said.
25	He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's  trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as  the United States.
31	Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary  officials of major industrialized countries saying the  importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange  rates had been underestimated.
24	All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the  right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he  said.
18	This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the  part of our american colleagues, he said.
18	But he said there was still a danger that the correction of  the dollar's value could overshoot.
19	In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the tender  and withdrawal rights will expire May Five unless extended.
42	The  offer, which has been approved by the Auxton aboard and is to be  followed by a merger at the same price, is conditioned on  receipt of a majority of Auxton's voting stock on a fully  diluted basis.
40	The company said research spending is running 50 to 60 pct  above a year ago as it its to commercialize its products as  quickly as possible, and increased expenditures are expected to  continue for several more quarters.
21	It said operating results  will fluctuate quarter to quarter, depending on the timing of  significant payments from commercial partners.
13	In the first three months of 1986, the company lost 150,000  dlrs.
19	The company changed its fiscal year in 1986 to a  calendar year from a year ending November 30.
17	For the first  quarter of last year, ended February 28, California Biotech  earned 114,000 dlrs.
26	He noted Unilever has been indicating plans to dispose of  Stauffer, plus some smaller assets of Chesebrough, since the  bid was made in December.
18	The Stauffer sale prospectus has been sent in recent weeks  to a number of companies expressing interest.
16	The Unilever spokesman declined to say how much the group  expected to receive for Stauffer.
16	Chesebrough's footwear and tennis cake businesses are  also likely to be disposed of, he added.
14	Immediately available financial information on Stauffer,  which is wholly-owned, was limited, he added.
12	Nine month sales  to September 1986 were about 1.2 billion dlrs.
21	Unilever aquired Chesebrough for 3.2 billion dlrs in order  to benefit from its well-known toiletry brands and food  products.

30	Mark IV Industries Inc ltIV started tendering for all  Conrac shares at 25 dlrs each on March 24 and owned 9.9 pct of  Conrac before starting the bid.
24	Conrac is a producer and marketer of computer-related  information display and communications equipment which also  produces special purpose architectural and industrial products.
11	It owns Code-A-Phone Corp, a producer of telephone  answering machines.
22	For 1986, the company reported profits of 7.8 mln dlrs, or  1.16 dlrs a share on sales of 153.9 mln dlrs.
8	It has nearly  6.8 mln shares outstanding
18	The products include fruit juices, pure and pulp, some  tomato products, peanuts, prepared beef products and beans.
24	The proposal will be used as the basis for a more detailed  LDP economic package to cut the trade surplus with the U.S.
23	The  party is expected to formalise the package before April 19,  when LDP General Council Chairman Shintaro Abe visits  Washington.
26	The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had presented  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
13	The pay despite went before a hearing of the Arbitration  Commission today.
19	Meanwhile, disruption bean today to cargo handling in the  ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
33	The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week  of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
39	Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of  Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an  ahead and procedures for meetings between the employers and  unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.
27	Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in  protest at employers' proposed for 350 redundancies from the  4,000-strong workforce this year.
28	The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on  March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction  against the redundancies on procedural grounds.
44	The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but  Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the  employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the  complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.
42	Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement  in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance  workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a  spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the last employer in the  sector, said.
26	The employers have written to the union asking it to  reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been  called for tomorrow.
38	In band one, it bought 31 mln stg of treasury bills and  three mln stg of bank bills at 9-7/8 pct, while in band two it  bought 69 mln stg of bank bills at 9-13/16 pct.
16	In addition, it  bought 63 mln stg of band three bank bills at 9-3/4 pct.
29	This brings the total assistance by the Bank so far today  to 219 mln stg against a liquidity shortage it has estimated at  around 300 mln stg.
32	today the company reported first quarter earnings of 20.6  mln dlrs on sales of 238.0 mln dlrs, up from earnings of 16.1  mln dlrs on sales of 188.8 mln dlrs.
26	Net includes pretax loan loss provisions of 90,000 dlrs vs  56,250 dlrs and gain on sale of securities of 113,432 dlrs vs  88,946 dlrs.
9	In March 1986, the figures stood at 2.4 pct.
34	Rod Canion, president and chief executive officer of  Compaq, said he expects sales of over 200 mln dlrs for the  period ending March 31, above analysts' estimates of 165-185  mln dlrs.
19	He added that earnings per share would exceed  analysts estimates of as high as 42 cts a share.
24	Compaq reported earnings of 8.3 mln dlrs, or 30 cts a  share, and sales of 144 mln dlrs for the first quarter 1986.
24	The company said demand for its DESKPRO 386, PORTABLE III  and the new COMPAQ DESKPRO 286 will contribute to the sales  increase.
32	The initial demand for the recently introduced COMPAQ  PORTABLE III and the new models of the COMPAQ DESKPRO 286  exceeds that of any other Compaq personal computers, nation  said.
21	We saw continued demand for our personal computers  across the quarter, with March 1987 being a particularly  strong month.

22	International Co said it  reached a preliminary agreement to sell the Hawaiian Insurance  Cos to Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. ltHE.
11	Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, the company  said.
24	The transaction is subject to the execution of definitive  agreements, certain governmental approvals and approvals by the  boards of directors involved, I.U.

27	Hawaiian Electric said the planned purchase was part of its  strategy to increase the company's investment in selected  service industries in Hawaii, including financial services.
26	Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,  Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased  the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
28	We are proposing legislation that would provide for more  disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would  insure that takeovers are property financed, he said.
48	Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold  for notifying the Securities and exchange Commission that a  investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a  company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within  10 days, Proxmire said.
26	In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirements  that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have  to filed with the SEC.
26	Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to  recent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in  knowing about coming takeover attempts.
33	Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a  under offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60  business days from the current 20 business days.
20	His bill would provide for private suits if the aquiring  company violated the time period on the tender offer.
24	To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire  said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin  requirments are properly enforced.
26	The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement  for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally  enforced in hostile takeover.
30	Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover  declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without  actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.
23	He said his bill wold allow private suits for damages for  failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin  requirements.
18	The bill also would require more disclose when several  investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
16	When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know  about it, Proxmire said.
23	Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain  towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all  shareholders recieve equal treatment
21	He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover  defense mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
21	Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this  month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.
13	He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this  year.
18	Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs  of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.
53	U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop  accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,  but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of the high  potential of a continued suspension that would result in  reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.
32	Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are  received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that  full-year net income will be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.
25	Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations  between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the  resumption of interest payments.
39	The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central  bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a  90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that  mature on April 15.
14	UK INTERVENTION BD SAYS EC SOLD 118,350 TONNES WHITE SA AT REBATE 46.496 ECUS.
31	Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness  of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and  Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
24	But he declined to say what measures would be discussed  ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later  today.
25	Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said  the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre  accord, had been underestimated.
46	Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major  countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual  meeting of the International Monetary Fund and world Bank,  marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major  trading partners.
12	There is no fundamental weakness of the rates accord, he  said.
19	We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do  not want to discuss that here.
18	Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a  slight firming of the yen against the dollar.
26	And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged  since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell  marks to export the dollar.
12	The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market he  said.
33	Poehl said West German had lived up to its side of the  bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be  accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
15	Poehl said, however, that an had not yet fulfilled its  pledges for economic stimulation.
34	And we will have to see if the United States is able to do  what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --  and get it through Congress, he added.
33	Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further  fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against  the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
10	You cannot except that to go unnoticed in an economy.
17	And  it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem, he  said.
41	 BOARD DETAILS EC SUGAR SALES  A total 118,350 tonnes of current series  white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.496  European Currency Units Ecus per 100 kilos at today's  European Community EC tender, the U.K.
4	Intervention Board  said.
7	Out of this, traders in the U.K.
25	Received 37,800 tonnes, in  France 34,500, in West Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in  Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added.
29	Earlier today, London traders had declined to give a  projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total  tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes
18	Paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes  being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 Ecu subsidy.
16	Cumulative sales authorisation for the current season  1986/87 now stand at 2,194,970 tonnes 43 weeks.
29	Last week saw 102,350 tonnes white authorised for export  under licences to end-Sep at the higest ever rebate of 46.864  European Currency Units Ecus per 100 kilos.
22	The generally strong outlook be well for significantly  improved earnings this year, Burnell Roberts, chairman and  chief executive officer said.
32	Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of  34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or  65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
19	In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing  operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
14	Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market  conditions and improved operations
22	The combination of capital improvement programs and more  employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper  operations, Robert said.
35	He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are  operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has  placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle  of the year.
20	Mead said sales of its unbleached noted paperboard was  particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.
4	Terms were not disclosed.
29	Ownership of the combined company with 18.8 pct for the  current shareholders of Canadian Bashaw and 81.2 pct to the  current shareholders of Erskine, the companies said.
6	The company went public during 1986.
23	Entourage also said it has started marketing a solid  perfume packaged in a lipstick tube called Amadeus, retailing  at 15 dlrs.
16	The company also said it has acquired North Country Media  Group, a five productions company.

37	Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date  for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April  23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman  added.
38	It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can  expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the  crop is off to a very good start, he said.
38	Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of  white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined A  and B quota of 872,000 tonnes.
40	This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-auto C sugar produced.
14	Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been  allotted quotas.
18	This is expected to present the area being  boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.
29	Out of this, traders in France received 34,500 tonnes, in  the U.K. 37,800, in West-Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in  Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes.
14	A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow  to discuss the payout.
6	A statement will be made afterwards.
28	VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach  this 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln  marks linked to the currency affair.
17	The figures is virtually  the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
27	When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it  said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark  dividend to the supervisory board.
15	A divided of 11 marks would  be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
18	Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of  the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
10	Anything else would be more than a surprise one said.
16	Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to  maintain the disclosed profit.
12	Parent company reserves stood at  around tree billion marks at end-1985.

46	The company said it bought alarm service operations  Certified Security Services Inc of Key West, Fla., Custom  Security Services of Myrtle Beach, S.C., A-T-E Security Group  Inc of Houston and the Louisville, Kent and Nashville, Tenn,  offices of Wells Fargo Alarm Services.
30	Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for  refined maize meal, a Zambian sales led to food riots in  which at least 15 people died.
25	That price increase, which president Kenneth Kaunda later  revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund  IMF to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
41	However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67  dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price  increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,  a practice discouraged by the IMF.
14	There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of  meal.
26	It the government would have to choose between the  demands of the IMF and those of the people, a Ministry of  Agriculture economist said.

23	The 0.50 cent a gallon price reduction brings Sun's heating  oil contract bare price to 50 cts a gallon, the company said.
29	They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
30	However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
46	Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27  millimetres in parts of  Aires province, 83 mm in  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
11	There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
23	Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the  crops, including soybean
30	However, as the lands began drying later in the week  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching betwen 36 and 40  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
28	Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yields  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
39	The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of  4.1 mln.
23	Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
14	Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area  sown.
23	It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
26	Production estimates for maize were down from last week at  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated  previously.
39	This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figures of 12.8 mln  tonnes.
21	Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares two to  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
19	sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco.
12	Harvest will set in La Pampa and  Buenos Aires in mid-April.
24	The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
44	The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2  mln tonne crop.
54	The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of  7.1 mln.
31	The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln  sown in 1985/86.
19	The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some  assets and producers fear they may discover more damage.
31	Some  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on area  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on  this were not available.
32	Preparations of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which  will be sown between May and August or September, has so far  not been as intense as in previous years.
20	The figures for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to  436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier.
20	The figure for  women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier  and 259,400 at end-March 1986.
17	On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in  the month to end-March to 692,200.
8	In March 1986 the figures was  725,000.
33	A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a  smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,  because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the  building industry.
11	He said this explained the increase in the  adjusted statistics.
11	Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at  end-March.

28	Economists expect the Fed to execute 2.0-2.5 billion dlrs  of customer repos to offset pressures from the end of the  two-week bank reserve maintenance period today.

20	The Federal funds rate opened at 6-3/8 pct and remained at  that level, up from yesterday's 6.17 pct average.
9	The purchase price was not disclosed, Reader's Digest said.
27	It said it purchased an 80 pct stake in Source in 1980 and  earned an unspecified profit on 14 mln dlrs in revenues in  1986.
48	The bank said the initial distribution would take the form  of a stock dividend of cumulative redeemable retractable class  A series two preferred shares entitling holders to monthly  floating rate dividend at 72 pct of prime and to 12.75 dlrs a  share on retraction.
12	Continental said the initial payout was subject to Canadian  government approval.
37	The bank reiterated that total distributions to common  shareholders would range from 16.50 dlrs a share to 17.25 dlrs  including the initial stock dividend and a final distribution  in late 1988 or early 1989.

45	PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY  Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.  dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will  propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record  profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,  major company executives predicted.
36	This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF  Corp ltGAF, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
25	Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc ltASH, the  Kentucky-based oil refiner and market are also shopping for  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
36	I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period, said  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co ltDOW, adding,  There's no major plant capacity being added around the world  now.
14	The whole game is bringing out new products and improving  the old ones.
29	Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
40	U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston.
22	Demand  for some products such as styrene would push profit margins up  by as much as 300 pct, he said.
37	Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its  history.
32	In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.  dollar Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs.
20	I believe the entire  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,  Oreffice said.
21	GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
19	Last year, the domestic industry owned a total of 13 billion  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
27	The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical  industry has been bought about by a combination of luck and  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
27	Dosher said last year's fall in oil price made feedstocks  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar  was weakening against foreign currencies.
7	That helped boosts  U.S. chemical exports.
34	Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers  in the early 1980s.
29	Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate  unrelated businesses.
13	The restructuring touched off a flurry of  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
34	GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire  into Carbide Corp ltUK, recently offered three billion dlrs  for Borg Warner Corp ltBOR, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics  and chemicals.
23	Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace ltGRA   has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
49	But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be  headed for trouble if companies continue sterling their back on  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
38	Companies like DuPont ltDD and Monsanto Co ltMTC spent the  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had  deteriorated, Dosher said.
19	But I think they will eventually  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche  market.
7	Some top chemical executives share the concern.
21	The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting  carried away and repeating past mistakes, GAF's Heyman  cautioned.
9	The shift from commodity chemicals may be  ill-advised.
7	specialty businesses do not stay special long.
29	Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can general 700  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
35	Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants  along the Texas Gulf Coast.
16	The plants product only basic commodity petrochemicals that  are the building blocks of specialty products.
29	This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a  glamorous, high-margin business, Cain said, adding that demand  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
33	Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood  and steel products.
29	Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

32	As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they  are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors, spokesman Michel  Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.
37	All the information that has been given out publicly is  that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an  acquisition that bigprobably based on that people are  starting all sorts of rumors, he said.
24	Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a  rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment  further.
16	Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell  was out of town and unavailable for comment.
31	Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-  U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln-  U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.
25	Dufour said the company has been negotiating with many  U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington  Industries was one of them.
37	Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,  which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher  Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider taking a  takeover offer.
32	Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1  mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has  repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S.
23	The company has said it plans to diversify into new product  and market areas in addition to expanding its textile  operations.
24	The company said revenue gains in electronics, major  appliances and other lines were offset by decreases in energy  services and aircraft products.
14	Revenues in the quarter rose  1.4 pct to 1.75 billon dlrs, it said.
18	The company said backed stood at 7.520 billion dlrs, down  from 7.912 billion dlrs a year earlier.
23	It said a five year  3.55 billion dlr U.S. defense contract was awarded shortly  after the close of the first quarter.
29	1986 qtr includes pretax gain of five mln dlrs from  settlement of litigation and tax gain of 5.1 mln dlrs from  change in estimated effective tax rate.
30	The sources said the depressed world market had been one of  the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the  11-member CPA which began on Monday.
27	They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the  after stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his  effort to support prices.
34	Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed  operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London  last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the  market soon.
27	prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa  surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has  to buy cocoa under stock rules.
22	The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range  by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.
19	The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,  commented one delegate repesenting a major CPA producer.
27	Another source said that with much of the 1986/87  October-September world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in  the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.
20	The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in  Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.
25	This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West  African producers, where sales are made or authorized by  commodity marketing boards.
22	The CPA includes the world's top three producers, over  Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.
9	The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

21	HRW laydays include June 20-30 on 5,000-7,000 tonnes, July  15-25 for 6,500-8,500 tonnes, and September 15-25 for  7,000-9,000 tonnes.

39	That decision spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest  payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20  mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the  first three months of 1986.
29	Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities  underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln  dlrs in the year-earlier period.
28	In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading  losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and  underwriting of Euromarket securities.
38	Conditions in some vectors of the Euromarket remained  difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering  heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether  Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
22	On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan  losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier
25	foreign  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
31	Morgan said other operating income, manly fees and  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
30	Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net daily fell  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
40	If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, with means  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct.
18	If brazil does not resume  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
34	for the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
31	It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
25	excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year  earlier.
25	Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from  303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to  personnel costs, Morgan said.
30	Ministry spokesman Leonard Brito, speaking from Brasilia,  told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this  year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
25	He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in  harvesting but that most of it would stem from storage  problems.
15	Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,  theoretically sufficient for the crop.
11	But prior said that the storage capacity was badly  distributed.
33	The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
19	The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West  growing regions, were rising production has outpaced storage  capacity.
31	Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
40	In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for  storing loose grain, Brito said.
12	Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the  crops.
29	The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop  has been evident from television reports, which have shown  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.
51	The company said shareholders approved the move at the  annual meeting in Providence today when the company reported  that its first quarter earnings rose to 38.5 mln dlrs, or 73  cts a share, from 31.7 mln dlrs, or 60 cts a share, in the  first quarter 1986.
29	J. Terence Murray, chairman and president of Fleet  Financial said, Fleet's mortgage banking activities in  particular continued to produce signficant income increases in  the first quarter.
22	Murray said Fleet's mortgage servicing portfolio reached  22.1 billion dlrs by March 31, including 1.8 billion dlrs  purchased in March.
35	In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations  had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges  for fuller, but still not completed access to market data  through Reuter services.
7	Many the markets maintain restrictions, he added.
16	Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that  information restrictions protected their interests.
26	In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the  distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage  to their own commercial information business.
29	He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the  telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect  their state monopolies at the expense of other economic  sectors.
9	Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such  countries.
17	As a result, banking communities serving entire  economies are put at a competitive disadvantage, he added.
30	Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from  the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues  to 620.9 mln stg.
10	Earnings per ordinary shares were up 47 pct to 19.4p.
13	The  annal shareholder meeting will be held in London on April 29.

14	CCL also said it agreed to exchange present and future  technology with Envases.
34	The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was  introduced as the lack of tin quotas was causing problems for  some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals  association said.
15	Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and   at 4,790.
25	The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a  tin price after the London Metal Exchange LME stopped tin  trading on October 24, 1985.
29	The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a  French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was  reliable, the spokesman said.
31	The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a  minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway  station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.
17	The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various  metal associations including the Association of white Metals.
18	after completion of the transaction, Tradevest would own 90  pct of the issued outstanding stock of Madeira.
16	It said the plan will be payable April 17 to shareholders  of record April 16.
53	Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's  Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a  net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs  of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value  of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.
20	Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps  to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.
41	The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable  fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of  international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S  where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division
24	In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont  contained its previous level of revenues and market share in  1986, Montedison said.
16	Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly  created position of president of Agrimont.
43	Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing  director of ltEridania SPA and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing  director of ltItaliana Olii e Sifi, both of whom are members  of the the Ferruzzi Group's management board, to Argimont's  board of directors
11	Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison  the company said.
33	According to terms of the proposed transaction, each share  of Data common stock, excluding those shares owned by the  four officers, will be bought for six dlrs a share, it said.
15	Datron's officers hold about 73 pct of the total 896,000  Datron common shares outstanding.
18	Upon completion of the proposed transaction, the offices  of Datron would own 100 pct of the company.
15	The merger is  subject to GGHF's receiving financing for the plan, petrol  said.
36	Shareholders of Datron will be asked to approve the plan at  their annual meeting to be held in June or July, and the merger  is expected to be completed by July 31, it said.
19	The possible acquisition is subject to any applicable real  estate gains and transfer taxes, the joint statement said.
31	Trump and Interstate, which presently own about 40 pct of  Alexander's common stock, said they intend to keep the company  as a retailer if they succed in their acquisition.
26	There can be no assurances that the parties will reach any  agreement regarding an acquisition or what price might be  offered, the statement said.
12	No official denied has been announced yet by Tunisia, they  said.
29	France has sold a total of 200,000 tonnes of soft wheat to  Tunisia since the begining of the current campaign which was  covered by COFACE export credits.
16	Of this amount, a total of  150,000 tonnes was exported by March 1, they said.

17	Saunders Co of Canada Ltd and Les frictions HRW Ltd by  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Canada Inc.
23	The government agency said, however, Harcourt Canada has  agreed to sell control of the firms to Canadian interests  within two years.
32	Harcourt Canada's U.S. parent, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich  Inc ltHBJ, indirectly acquired the Canadian book publishing  companies when it purchased Holt Rinehart and Winston from CBS  Inc ltCBS last October.
33	The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose  4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and  Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct  stake.
21	A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly  acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover  offer.
16	Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for  Montreal-based Dominion called the report just rumors.
11	Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
28	Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of  the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if  Burlington actually came into play.
13	Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,  and credence to the speculation.
46	Dominion has said that it  was looking for a takeover in the U.S.      Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for  a U.S. acquisition
27	A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer  has been negotiating with many U.S. textile companies, but  would n
